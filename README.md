This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites (Optional)

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as a compiler and package manager. To install Bun, follow the instructions on the [official Bun website](https://bun.sh/).



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Building the Project
To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
bun next build
```

This will create a production-ready build of your Next.js application.
